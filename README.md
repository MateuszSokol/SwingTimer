# SwingTimer
A simple Pomodoro-style countdown timer built in Java using the Swing GUI toolkit. The application displays a small always-on-top window that counts down (default: 25 minutes). It's designed with a clear separation between GUI and timer logic, and makes use of TimerTask for scheduling updates.
